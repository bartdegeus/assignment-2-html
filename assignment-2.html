<!--l. 17--><p class="noindent" >In this modeling assignment we will introduce a subsidy to education in the
model used in section 13.3.2 of Aghion and Howitt (2009). In section 13.3.2
Aghion and Howitt describe a model that was inspired by Acemoglu (1997) and
Redding (1996). The model looks at the composition of education spending and
the way it interacts with the level of technological development in a country.
Individuals make a decision regarding the amount of investment in education in
period 1. At the same time, entrepreneurs decide how much they would like to
invest in innovation. These decisions depend on the expected level of productivity
growth and the expected level of human capital respectively. Thus, the
decisions depend on the decision of the other party and as a result of this
interaction; there are multiple growth paths; a low-growth equilibrium
and a high-growth equilibrium. Since it is hard to leave the low growth
equilibrium this equilibrium is often called a low-development trap. Here, we
will introduce subsidies on education and see what the result of this
subsidy is on the equilibriums and whether this might be a solution for the
low-development trap. First, we will give an overview of the model in section
13.3.2.

<!--l. 21--><p class="noindent" >In this model all individuals live for two periods and are born with a level of
human capital that is equal to one. Individuals, as in most models, maximize
their utility, with a discount factor for consumption in the future since they value
consumption today more than consumption tomorrow.

the young in every period. These function are given by the following
formulas:

<!--l. 34--><p class="nopar" >
<!--l. 36--><p class="indent" >   The earnings of individuals when they are young equal the amount of
production time times the existing leading-edge technology, since this is the
amount they produce when they are self-employed. Human capital is present in
equation (2) but it is normalized to one. Here we assume that individuals work
for a firm when they are old. Old individuals earn a fraction of the output
surplus in which the level of human capital and the level of the leading-edge
technology determine this output surplus. Individuals cannot decide upon the
level of the leading-edge technology but they can influence their level of human
capital when they are old. When they invest in education when they are young,
their human capital when they are old will be higher than the level of human
capital when they were young. The more they will invest in education, the
higher the increase in human capital is; this is formulated in equation
(4).

<!--l. 45--><p class="indent" >   Thus, there is a trade-off between the costs (decrease in production
time when young) and the benefits (increase in human capital when
old) of education. When individuals maximize their utility, they make a
decision regarding the fraction of their working time they want to invest in
education when they are young. After inserting the equation for human
capital (4) in the consumption function (3) and inserting the consumption
functions (2) and (3) in the utility function (1) it is possible to maximize the
utility function with respect to <img 
src="assignment-25x.png" alt="&#x03BD;  "  class="math" >. Rewriting this first order condition
gives:

<!--l. 56--><p class="indent" >   Equation (4) shows the optimal fraction of working time individuals invest in
education. When individuals invest this fraction in education their utility is
maximized. As equation (4) shows this fraction depends on the <span

productivity growth in the country. When individuals expect that the
productivity growth will be high, they will invest more in education. Figure 1
shows this correlation between expected productivity growth and the level of
human capital.

<!--l. 98--><p class="noindent" >The decision of individuals how much to invest in education depends on the
expected level of productivity growth. At the same time, the decision of
entrepreneurs whether or not to invest in innovation depends on the expected
level of human capital. Unfortunately, the expected levels are not given but we
can combine both figures when we assume that individuals and entrepreneurs
behave rational. When both the individuals and the entrepreneurs hold rational
beliefs there are two Nash equilibria. In figure 3 the decision making lines from
the entrepreneurs and from the individuals are combined and you see that the
lines cross three times. When the human capital line crosses the innovation
decision line by the entrepreneurs when the last line is horizontal, there is no
equilibrium since entrepreneurs either invest maximal or do not invest at all.
That means, that the equilibria only exists on the vertical parts of the
innovation decision line by the entrepreneurs. Figure 3 shows that there is a
low-growth equilibrium and a high-growth equilibrium. When the entrepreneurs
expect that the level of human capital will be below the horizontal line
they will not invest in innovation and when the individuals expect that
the entrepreneurs do not invest in innovation they will invest a smaller
amount in education. This results in the equilibria presented in the figure
below. When the economy is in the low-growth equilibria and neither the
individuals nor the entrepreneurs expect that the other party invest more in
education or innovation the economy cannot get out of this low-growth
equilibria.

<!--l. 107--><p class="noindent" >We will now introduce a subsidy to education. Below, we discuss the effects of a
subsidy to education, but first we will describe how the subsidy is inserted into
the model. In this section, every employee receives a subsidy that depends on the
fraction of time that person allocates to education, i.e. a quantity subsidy. Thus,
the more one invests in education, the larger the subsidy one receives.
Furthermore, we assume for now that no taxes are levied on individuals to pay
for the subsidy. The consumption functions for individuals in each period now
become:

<!--l. 117--><p class="indent" >   Equation (9) shows that the introduction of the subsidy makes investing in
education less expensive. To see whether the subsidy makes individuals more
willing to invest more in education, the utility function is maximized with respect

to <img

<!--l. 131--><p class="indent" >   </div><hr class="endfigure">
<!--l. 133--><p class="indent" >   The graph above graphically presents the above-mentioned finding: a positive
subsidy increases the fraction of working time people invest in education when
the other parameters do not change. The human capital line shifts upwards due
to the introduction of a subsidy on education. When the subsidy on education
increases, the human capital line shifts even more upwards. In this specific
example the subsidy resulted in only one equilibrium: a high-growth equilibrium.
Thus, the low development trap disappeared by introducing the subsidy. We are
interested in the level of subsidy for which it is no longer possible to end
up in an equilibrium of low growth. The subsidy is optimal when the
human capital level goes through the dotted line at the moment where
productivity is one. This gives the following equation for the optimal
subsidy:

<!--l. 141--><p class="nopar" >
<!--l. 143--><p class="indent" >   Thus, when a government wants to implement a subsidy to prevent the
low-development trap from occurring the government should set the subsidy
slight above the right hand side of equation 12. It is inefficient for society when
the government sets the equilibrium subsidy much higher since this would not
result in a higher growth level of the economy.
<!--l. 145--><p class="indent" >   Figure 5 shows the formula of human capital that includes the optimal
subsidy. The human capital line crosses the innovation decision line by the
entrepreneurs when <img

than the right hand side of equation (12), the human capital line crosses the line
representing the choice of the entrepreneurs only once, in the high-growth
equilibrium.

is no population growth, so the old households should pay the subsidy of the
young individuals. Since all individuals are identical in the way that they have
the same utility function, they will make the same decision regarding the fraction

Furthermore when <img

do not give a higher valuation to consumption today compared to consumption
tomorrow; thus when people receive an amount today and have to pay an

<!--l. 187--><p class="nopar" >
<!--l. 189--><p class="indent" >   The optimal subsidy level when the subsidy is paid by levying taxes is higher
than in the case without taxes. Again, this is straightforward since the taxes
discourage individuals to invest in their human capital since they can only
capture <img 
src="assignment-229x.png" alt="1- &#x03C4;  "  class="math" > of their benefits when they are old instead of the complete
amount. The optimal subsidy equation (17) differs from the optimal subsidy
equation (12) in one thing. When taxes are introduced, the optimal subsidy as in
equation (12) needs to be divided by <img 
src="assignment-230x.png" alt="1 - &#x03C1;  "  class="math" >. Again, this is straightforward since
in the hypothetical case where <img 
src="assignment-231x.png" alt="&#x03C1; = 0  "  class="math" > there is no difference between both
equations since individuals do not attach any value to consumption in the
future and do not care about the amount of taxes they have to pay in the
future.

<!--l. 217--><p class="indent" >   According to Mankiw et al. (1992) the return to human capital is two-thirds,
therefore we have set <img 
src="assignment-240x.png" alt="&#x03B2; = 23   "  class="math" >. Furthermore, we believe individuals do not
discount their future consumption that much and therefore we have set
<img 
src="assignment-241x.png" alt="&#x03C1; = 0.8  "  class="math" >. Since there is no further information about the initial level of
productivity we have normalized this level to<img 
src="assignment-242x.png" alt="1  "  class="math" > for simplicity. Theta was chosen
to be smaller than <img 
src="assignment-243x.png" alt="0.5  "  class="math" > to make sure there are diminishing returns to
human capital. Some other parameters were chosen more in line with
the model to make sure the model shows multiple growth paths. For
example, we have set <img 
src="assignment-244x.png" alt="&#x03B1; = 0.3  "  class="math" > while in reality we believe <img 
src="assignment-245x.png" alt="&#x03B1;  "  class="math" > is bigger than
<img 
src="assignment-246x.png" alt="0.3  "  class="math" >.
<!--l. 219--><p class="indent" >   Entrepreneurs decide to invest in innovation when the level of human
capital is above a certain level; given in equation (8). When the level of
human capital is above <img 
src="assignment-247x.png" alt="2.25  "  class="math" >, entrepreneurs will invest maximally in
innovation and when the level of human capital is below <img 
src="assignment-248x.png" alt="2.25  "  class="math" > they will not
invest at all. When entrepreneurs invest maximal, the innovation will
occur with certainty and therefore the new productivity level will be at
<img 
src="assignment-249x.png" alt="&#x03BB; = 1.5  "  class="math" >.
<!--l. 221--><p class="indent" >   Without a subsidy, the human capital level is given in equation (4), and after
inserting the numbers it is <img

subsidy is introduced, the question is for which subsidy the economy ends up in
the high-growth equilibrium with certainty. Equation (16) is used to answer this
question. When the subsidy set by the government is higher than <img 
src="assignment-251x.png" alt="13.65%  "  class="math" >, the
low-development trap no longer occurs. When the tax is introduced equation (17)
is used to calculate the optimal subsidy in case the subsidies are paid by
levying taxes on the old individuals. Equation (17) gives that the subsidy
should lie slightly above <img 
src="assignment-252x.png" alt="68.24%  "  class="math" > in order to be effective, that means,
in order to make sure a country is in the high-growth equilibrium for
certain.
